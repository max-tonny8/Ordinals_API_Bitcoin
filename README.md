# API Reference

See the [Ordinals API Reference](https://docs.hiro.so/ordinals/) for more
information.

# Quick Start

## System Requirements

The Ordinals API has hard dependencies on other systems.
Before you start, you'll need to have access to:

1. An [Ordhook node](https://github.com/hirosystems/ordhook) with a fully
   indexed Ordinals database.
1. A local writeable Postgres database for data storage.
   * We recommended a 1TB volume size here.

## Running the API

1. Clone the repo.

1. Create an `.env` file and specify the appropriate values to configure the local
API server, postgres DB and Ordhook node reachability. See
[`env.ts`](https://github.com/hirosystems/ordinals-api/blob/develop/src/env.ts)
for all available configuration options.

1. Build the app (NodeJS v18+ is required)
    ```
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

1. Start the service
    ```
    npm run start
    ```

### Run Modes

To better support auto-scaling server configurations, this service supports
three run modes specified by the `RUN_MODE` environment variable:

* `default`: Runs all background jobs and the API server. Use this when you're
  running this service only on one instance. This is the default mode.
* `readonly`: Runs only the API server. Use this in an auto-scaled cluster when
  you have multiple `readonly` instances and just one `writeonly` instance. This
  mode needs a `writeonly` instance to continue populating the DB.
* `writeonly`: Use one of these in an auto-scaled environment so you can
  continue consuming new inscriptions. Use in conjunction with multiple
  `readonly` instances as explained above.

### Stopping the API

When shutting down, you should always prefer to send the `SIGINT` signal instead
of `SIGKILL` so the service has time to finish any pending background work and
all dependencies are gracefully disconnected.

# Bugs and feature requests
